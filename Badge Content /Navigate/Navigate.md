## Task 3 Ping Kong
For many, "the Internet" is an abstract and overwhelming concept. This activity will challenge you to think concretely about how the internet communicates with a computer, learning about **navigating.**

**Task**

Start by watching this [video] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwyJGzZmBe8) and familiarise yourself with these [Key Terms.] ((https://github.com/mozilla/webmaker-curriculum/wiki/Glossary))

**Evidence:**

Imagine this scenario: You're at the computer and decide to watch a video on YouTube. After you type in the web address, the computer converts 'youtube.com' into a code that all computers can read and then divides that code into several internet **"packets".** What happens at each of the different stages of the packets **"journey"?**
* Local Router
* Internet Service Provider
* Company Router
* Website

Summarise the journey the packet takes - you can submit your evidence in which ever format you feel comfortable with. Perhaps as a video with some of your peers taking on different roles within the journey - or simply a written summary of what is happening.
