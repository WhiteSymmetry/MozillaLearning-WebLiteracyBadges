#Protect

A framework for entry-level web literacy & 21st Century skills. Participate - Protect: Managing and maintaining the privacy and security of your digital identity through behaviours and digital tool settings.

##Task 1 Understanding Security
You will test the strength of passwords using tools called password meters. You will look at **annual lists of the top 25 worst passwords**, compiled from more than 3.3 million leaked passwords during each year and **make a collage** of what to avoid when creating a password.

**Task**
* Check out the [worst passwords] (https://www.teamsid.com/worst-passwords-of-2014/) list and think about what you would use to make a really strong password.
* Use this [link] (https://howsecureismypassword.net/) to check out how secure your password is!

**Evidence**
You are going to create your own **Bad Password** collage - you could create this either offline - [like this] (http://lorrie.cranor.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/IMG_4821.jpg) - or online using something like [WordCloud.] (http://www.wordclouds.com/)
