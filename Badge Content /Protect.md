#Protect

A framework for entry-level web literacy & 21st Century skills. Participate - Protect: Managing and maintaining the privacy and security of your digital identity through behaviours and digital tool settings.

##Task 1 Understanding Security
You will test the strength of passwords using tools called password meters. You will look at **annual lists of the top 25 worst passwords**, compiled from more than 3.3 million leaked passwords during each year and **make a collage** of what to avoid when creating a password, learning about **protecting.**

**Task**
* Check out the [worst passwords] (https://www.teamsid.com/worst-passwords-of-2014/) list and think about what you would use to make a really strong password.
* Use this [link] (https://howsecureismypassword.net/) to check out how secure your password is!

**Evidence**
You are going to create your own **Bad Password** collage - you could create this either offline - [like this] (http://lorrie.cranor.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/IMG_4821.jpg) - or online using something like [WordCloud.] (http://www.wordclouds.com/)

**21C Skills:**

* [Problem-Solving] (https://learning.mozilla.org/en-US/web-literacy/skills/#problem-solving)

##Task 2 Draw Secure Passwords
You will learn about **pass-phrases, pronounceable and random passwords** using generators. You will **find out what you can do to create better passwords, and explore different types of passwords** to learn about their pros and cons, learning about **protecting.**

**Task**
* Try out this [Passphrase Generator] (http://preshing.com/20110811/xkcd-password-generator/) and create some of your own unique pass phrases.
* Create the following types of pass phrases using the generator: **Pronouncable, Random, Basic 8 and Basic 16**

**Evidence**
Answer the following questions, and reflect upon your answers - are your pass phrases safe and secure?
* How long is your password?
* Does it have a digit?
* Does it have a symbol?
* Do you write your passwords down?
* Do you reuse your passwords?

**21C Skills:**

* [Problem-Solving] (https://learning.mozilla.org/en-US/web-literacy/skills/#problem-solving)

##Task 3 Werewolf-in-the-Middle
You will be introduced to the basics of **surveillance and man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks** with this social activity adapted from the popular party game Werewolf, learning about **protecting.**

**Task**

* Explore and being to understand online [man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack)
* Expand your knowledge of Encryption by taking a look at the latest [Mozilla Advocacy Campaign - Encrypt] (https://advocacy.mozilla.org/en-US/encrypt/codemoji/1)
* Reflect upon your understanding of **MITM** attacks and what you can do to help defend yourself

**Evidence:**

In your own words, how do MITM attacks work?
* How does sending un-encrypted information across the Internet help bad actors who perform MITM attacks?
* What are some ways you can think of to protect your information, even if it's intercepted?
* What questions do you have about how to make your own communications more secure?

**21C Skills: **

* [Communication] (https://learning.mozilla.org/en-US/web-literacy/skills/#communication)
* [Collaboration] (https://learning.mozilla.org/en-US/web-literacy/skills/#collaboration)
* [Problem-Solving] ((https://learning.mozilla.org/en-US/web-literacy/skills/#problem-solving))

##Task 4 Really Private Messaging
You will learn the basic importance and mechanics of encryption, modelling public-private key encryption schemes with simple tools like paper and markers, crayons, or coloured pencils, thereby learning how to **collaborate, connect, evaluate encryption schemes, and secure their communications online,** learning about **protecting.**

**Task**
* Try your own Caesar Cipher using this [pen from MattC.K] (http://codepen.io/MattCK/pen/OyQyxE)
* Watch this [awesome video] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QnD2c4Xovk&feature=youtu.be) on Public & Private Keys
* Create your own Colour Key - find out more [here] (http://chadsansing.github.io/curriculum-testing/encryption/really-private-messaging.html#step-4)

Evidence

In general terms and in your **own words**, can you summarise how public-private key encryption works?
