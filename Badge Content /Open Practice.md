* Install [Lightbeam] (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/lightbeam/) and visit your 5 favourite websites - using Lightbeam see who is tracking you and documenting your movement across the web
* You will need to reflect on the information you have found, and be able to talk about how your journey across the web is being tracked

**Evidence:**

Answer the following questions:
* Which trackers are the same?
* What was surprising?
* Which site that you visit has the most trackers?
* Why should or why shouldn't everyone should have the tools to investigate who collects data on them?
