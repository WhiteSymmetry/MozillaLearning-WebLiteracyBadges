Start teaching others how to read, write and participate on the web with these free activities created by teachers, educators and technologists like you. Each featured activity includes step-by-step instructions and has been tested in schools, after school programs, libraries and community centres around the globe. Whether learning how to code, understanding why privacy matters, or creating openly-licensed web content, we believe teaching the web should be fun and engaging!

**DigitalMe** have been working alongside the Mozilla Learning team to explore, build and provide open access to a suite of Web Literacy Badges for use within both formal and non-formal educational settings. 

You can see a fully implemented version of these badges on both:
* [Open Badge Academy] (https://www.openbadgeacademy.com/mozillalearning "Mozilla Learning Badges on OBA")
* [Credly]

As well as requested access to the badges via these methods, you can also fork this repository and create your own instances of the badges on whichever platform you choose. Within this repository we have provided the following media to the be used for non-commerical purposes which must always reference back to **Mozilla Learning** and **DigitalMe**
